# faq-frontend-mentor
This repository contains a responsive FAQ accordion component built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is designed to improve frontend skills, following a coding challenge from Frontend Mentor. Users can expand and collapse FAQ items, making it suitable for a range of web development projects where a clean FAQ section is required.
